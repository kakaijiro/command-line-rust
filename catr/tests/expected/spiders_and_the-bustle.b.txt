     1	Don't worry, spiders,
     2	I keep house
     3	casually.     4	The bustle in a house
     5	The morning after death
     6	Is solemnest of industries
     7	Enacted upon earth,â€”

     8	The sweeping up the heart,
     9	And putting love away
    10	We shall not want to use again
    11	Until eternity.
